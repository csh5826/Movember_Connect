## Movember Connect

Movember is an annual event involving the growing of mustaches during the month of November to raise awareness for men's health issues. This application aims to connect participants globally so they can share their stories and better understand how big of an impact the Movember movement is making.

## Motivation

This cause means a lot to me as I know many men that struggle with mental health issues and have a long family line of prostate cancer. This is also my capstone project for the Project Shift Fellowship cohort 10.

## Technologies

React/Redux, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, Express, Material-UI, Mapbox GL, Chart.js
